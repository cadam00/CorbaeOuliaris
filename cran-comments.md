# corbouli 0.1.2

## Major changes

- Update `corbae_ouliaris` so as to use the correct regression formula. The
previous one included constant at the regression, which is not the case here.
If you have done any computations with versions 0.1.1 or 0.1.0, then you are
advised to repeat them.

## Minor changes

- Update README.md and Introduction.Rmd.
